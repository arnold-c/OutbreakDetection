Calculate outbreak thresholds from SEIR simulation results using outbreak specifications.

This method extracts incidence data from SEIR simulation results and delegates to the
core outbreak threshold calculation function. It provides a convenient interface when
working with structured SEIR simulation outputs.

# Arguments
- `seir_results::StructVector{SEIRRun}`: Structured vector of SEIR simulation results
- `outbreak_specification::OutbreakSpecification`: Configuration specifying outbreak criteria

# Returns
- `StructVector{OutbreakThresholds}`: Outbreak threshold information for each simulation

    ) where {VSV <: AbstractVector{<:AbstractVector}}

Calculate outbreak thresholds from incidence timeseries using specified outbreak criteria.

This function processes multiple incidence timeseries to identify outbreak periods that
meet specified criteria for threshold, duration, and size. It applies threshold detection
to each timeseries and classifies periods as outbreaks based on the outbreak specification
parameters.

The detection process involves:
1. Identifying periods where incidence exceeds the outbreak threshold
2. Calculating bounds and durations of these periods
3. Classifying periods as outbreaks based on minimum duration and size criteria
4. Returning only those periods that qualify as true outbreaks

# Arguments
- `incidence_vecs::VSV`: Vector of incidence timeseries (each element is a vector of infection counts)
- `outbreak_specification::OutbreakSpecification`: Configuration containing:
  - `outbreak_threshold`: Minimum daily incidence to consider for outbreak detection
  - `minimum_outbreak_duration`: Minimum number of consecutive days for outbreak classification
  - `minimum_outbreak_size`: Minimum total infections during outbreak period

# Returns
- `StructVector{OutbreakThresholds}`: Structured vector where each element contains outbreak
  information for one simulation, with fields:
  - `lower_bounds`: Starting indices of outbreak periods
  - `upper_bounds`: Ending indices of outbreak periods
  - `duration`: Duration of each outbreak period
  - `num_infections_during_bounds`: Total infections during each outbreak period

# Examples
```julia
# Define outbreak criteria
outbreak_spec = OutbreakSpecification(
    outbreak_threshold = 5,
    minimum_outbreak_duration = 7,
    minimum_outbreak_size = 50
)

# Calculate outbreaks from incidence data
incidence_data = [rand(1:10, 100) for _ in 1:50]  # 50 simulations
outbreaks = calculate_outbreak_thresholds(incidence_data, outbreak_spec)

# Analyze results
println("Number of simulations with outbreaks: ",
        sum(length(outbreak.lower_bounds) > 0 for outbreak in outbreaks))
```

In-place calculation of outbreak thresholds for performance optimization.

This function performs the core outbreak detection algorithm by processing each incidence
timeseries and storing results directly in the pre-allocated output vector. It uses a
reusable worker vector to minimize memory allocations during the threshold detection process.

The algorithm for each simulation:
1. Creates a boolean mask for incidence values above threshold
2. Applies run-length encoding to identify consecutive above-threshold periods
3. Calculates bounds and durations using [`calculate_above_threshold_bounds`](@ref)
4. Classifies periods as outbreaks using [`classify_all_outbreaks`](@ref)
5. Stores results in the pre-allocated output vector

# Arguments
- `outbreak_threshold_vecs`: Pre-allocated vector to store OutbreakThresholds results
- `incidence_vecs`: Vector of incidence timeseries to process
- `outbreakthreshold`: Minimum daily incidence for outbreak consideration
- `minoutbreakdur`: Minimum consecutive days for outbreak classification
- `minoutbreaksize`: Minimum total infections for outbreak classification

# Returns
- `nothing`: Results are stored in-place in `outbreak_threshold_vecs`

# Performance Notes
- Uses a single pre-allocated boolean worker vector to minimize allocations
- Processes simulations sequentially with `@inbounds` optimization
- Designed for high-performance batch processing of many simulations
