# Results

## Tables

::: {#tbl-optimal-thresholds-accuracy}

```{=typst}
#let accuracy = csv("optimal-thresholds_accuracy.csv")

#table(
  columns: 9,
    fill: (x, y) => {
      if y == 0 {gray}
      if y == 1 {gray}
    },
  [], table.cell(colspan: 2, align: center, "Test Characteristic"), table.cell(colspan: 6, align: center, "Testing Rate"),
  ..accuracy.flatten()
)
```

The outbreak detection accuracy for each testing scenario, at the optimal thresholds.

:::

::: {#tbl-optimal-thresholds-unavoidable}

```{=typst}
#let optimal_thresholds = csv("optimal-thresholds_unavoidable-cases.csv")

#table(
  columns: 9,
    fill: (x, y) => {
      if y == 0 {gray}
      if y == 1 {gray}
    },
  [], table.cell(colspan: 2, align: center, "Test Characteristic"), table.cell(colspan: 6, align: center, "Testing Rate"),
  ..optimal_thresholds.flatten()
)
```

Unavoidable cases per annum of each testing scenario at their specific optimal thresholds, scaled up to Ghanaâ€™s 2022 population. A) the noise structure is dynamical, and the seasonality is in-phase with the measles incidence. B) the noise structure is Poisson only.

::: {#tbl-optimal-thresholds-delays}

```{=typst}
#let optimal_thresholds = csv("optimal-thresholds_detection-delays.csv")

#table(
  columns: 9,
    fill: (x, y) => {
      if y == 0 {gray}
      if y == 1 {gray}
    },
  [], table.cell(colspan: 2, align: center, "Test Characteristic"), table.cell(colspan: 6, align: center, "Testing Rate"),
  ..optimal_thresholds.flatten()
)
```

Outbreak alert delay (days) of each testing scenario at their specific optimal thresholds. A) the noise structure is dynamical, and the seasonality is in-phase with the measles incidence. B) the noise structure is Poisson only.
